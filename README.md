User Service with OTP
This project implements a user service with OTP (One-Time Password) functionality. The service is built using Node.js, with MongoDB as the database. It includes features such as user authentication, password hashing, and OTP generation and verification.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user login and registration with hashed passwords.
OTP Verification: Generate and verify one-time passwords for user authentication or other actions.
Environment Configuration: Manage environment variables using dotenv.
Email Notifications: Send OTPs via email using nodemailer.
MongoDB Integration: Use Mongoose for database interactions.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/userservice-with-otp.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd userservice-with-otp
